# Task 1

## Descripion

Write a smart contract for a Crypto Donations platform using Remix IDE. One Solidity file will be perfect for now. Administrator have the ability to create new campaigns. Each campaign have its name, description, time goal & money raised goal. This version of a platform accepts only donations in chain's native coin. Deploy smart contract to testnet of your choice (Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, Goerli) and verify it on Etherscan.

## Additional features I have added

Administrator (contract owner) can lock and unlock campaigns which will prevent anyone from interacting with them.
